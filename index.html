    <h2>Work History</h2>
    <p>My first employment was within retail alongside studying. I then moved onto working in the luxury travel industy where my main role was using a ticketing code system to issue flights. After this i spent some time travelling and then decided to train as a veterinary nurse; to which i progressed to head nurse of the veterinary hospital. My most current employment was for a family business where i moved the business online and managed all bookings, website and itineraries. Here i became much more interested in the development of html sites and understanding how they function. I then enrolled onto a html developer bootcamp in order to expand my kmowledge and hopefully have a career in this sector. </p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Here's</b> two examples of applications i have developed <a href="placeholder">Shopping Site</a> and <a href="placeholder">Private Clinic</a>. </p>
